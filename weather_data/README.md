# Weather data and solar radiation on a tilted surface

**Objectives**:

- Download weather data in EnergyPlus format 
- Read weather data 
- Find solar radiation on a tilted surface 
- Visualize the data 

The weather file with the extension `.epw` can be dowloaded from: 
- [Climate.OneBuilding.Org](http://climate.onebuilding.org): folder of files at the repository of free climate data for building performance simulation,
- [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/weather): interactive map with locations,
- [LadyBug Tools](http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/): interactive map with locations,
- [PV GIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/tools.html): interractive map with interpollated data.

For example, this folder contains the files:
- `FRA_AR_Lyon-Bron.AP.074800_TMYx.2004-2018.epw`
- `FRA_Lyon.074810_IWEC.epw`

for the airport Lyon-Bron, France (N45.73, E5.08).

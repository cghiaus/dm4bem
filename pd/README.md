# State-space models for building simulation by using Pandas[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmg-git/pd_dm4bem/HEAD)## Work flow1. `wall2TC`: Describe disassembled thermal networks:    - Thermal network: A, G, C, b, f, y    - files `wall_types` & `walls_data` -> thermal networks2. `bldg_folder2TC`: Put all disassembled thermal circuit in disassebled thermal cirsuit TCd.3. `assembly`: Assemble disassembled thermal networks.    - Use two methods: assembling matrix and assembling lists4. `TC2SS`: Thermal circuit -> state-space__To do:__5. `State-space with input`    - Inputs: `bldg` folder and `weather` for a period of time    - Outputs: state-space A, B, C, D and input u vector (in time) composed of: weather files and schedule files in the input vector. _To do_: input vector by considring to resample the inputs for the simulation time-step.6. Numerical integration: explicit and/or implicit Euler## Wall to disassembled thermal circuitsInput files in `\bldg_data`:    - type: material thermal properties and width of a type of building element    - element: type, boundary conditions and surface    - assembly: common nodes of elementsOutput:    - thermal circuit of the building: TC = {A, G, C, b, f, y}Intermediary outputs:    - thermal circuit TC = {A, G, C, b, f, y} of each componentContents of file ..._type.csv:    Type: str same for different materials in the same element-type    Material: str    Conductivity: float of Material, W⋅K⁻¹    Specific heat: float of Material, J⋅kg⁻¹⋅K⁻¹    Density:float of Material, kg⋅m⁻³    Width: float of material, m    Mesh: int number of meshes for layer discretizationContents of file ..._element.csv:    Component: str name of the building component (wall, floor, window, etc.)    Type: same as "Type" from file `..._type.csv`    Area: float area surface of the wall, m²    ho: float surface heat coefficient, surface 0, W⋅m⁻²⋅K⁻¹    hi: float surface heat coefficient, surface 1, W⋅m⁻²⋅K⁻¹    α0: float [0, 1] short-wave radiation absortivity, surface 0, -    α1: float [0, 1] short-wave radiation absortivity, surface 1, -    ε0: float [0, 1] long-wave radiation emmisivity, surface 0, -    ε1: float [0, 1] long-wave radiation emmisivity, surface 1, -    To: str name of the out temperature source; " " if no source    Ti: str name of the in temperature source; " " if no source    Qo: str name of the out flow source; " " if no source    Qi: str name of the in flow source; " " if no source
